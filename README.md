Appleceiver
===========
Arduino project for Leonardo/Teensy or other USB sort into an apple TV remove receiver for XBMC that works as a keyboard.

Setup
-----
* Attach a 38Khz PCM demodulating IR reveiver to pin 5.
* LED is set to pin 6 by default. (stupid Teensy, why did I buy it?)
* Copy kayboard.xml into ~/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/ for working volume control.
* Make sure you set the USB mode to Keyboard when your program your 'duino.
* Just plug it in.
